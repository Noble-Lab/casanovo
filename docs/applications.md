# Applications of Casanovo

De novo peptide sequencing has diverse applications in proteomics ranging from antibody sequencing to paleoproteomics. Here are some papers that use Casanovo for de novo sequencing in different domains:

- **[Cryo-EM reveals that cardiac IGLV6-derived AL fibrils can be polymorphic](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.04.626857)** Casanovo is used to de novo sequence fibrils, i.e. antibody light chain aggregates.

- **[Comprehensive evaluation of peptide de novo sequencing tools for monoclonal antibody assembly](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbac542)** Casanovo is used to de novo sequence monoclonal antibodies and shown to outperform other de novo sequencing tools.

- **[Giant genes are rare but implicated in cell wall degradation by predatory bacteria](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.21.568195)** Casanovo is used to de novo sequence giant proteins with up to 85,804 amino acids in a metagenomic setting.

- **[De novo assembled databases enable species-specific protein-based stable isotope probing of microbiomes without prior knowledge of the community composition](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.25.625156)** Casanovo is used to de novo sequence microbial peptides to enable species-specific protein-based stable isotope probing.

- **[Systematic benchmarking of mass spectrometry-based antibody sequencing reveals methodological biases](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.11.622451)** Casanovo is used to profile the sequence diversity of circulating monoclonal antibody repertoire.

# Applications of Casanovo

_De novo_ peptide sequencing has diverse applications in proteomics, ranging from antibody sequencing to paleoproteomics.
You can find some papers that use Casanovo for _de novo_ sequencing in different domains below.
Contact us with your applications of Casanovo to feature your research on this page by opening a Github issue [here](https://github.com/Noble-Lab/casanovo/issues/new) with a link to the paper and a one-sentence description of how Casanovo is being used.

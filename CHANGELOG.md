# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [3.3.0] - 2023-04-04

### Added

- Included the `min_peptide_len` parameter in the configuration file to restrict predictions to peptide with a minimum length.
- Export multiple PSMs per spectrum using the `top_match` parameter in the configuration file.

### Changed

- Calculate the amino acid scores as the average of the amino acid scores and the peptide score.
- Spectra from mzML and mzXML peak files are referred to by their scan numbers in the mzTab output instead of their indexes.

### Fixed

- Verify that the final predicted amino acid is the stop token.
- Spectra are correctly matched to their input peak file when analyzing multiple files simultaneously.
- The score of the stop token is taken into account when calculating the predicted peptide score.
- Peptides with incorrect N-terminal modifications (multiple or internal positions) are no longer predicted.

## [3.2.0] - 2022-11-18

### Changed

- Update PyTorch Lightning global seed setting.
- Use beam search decoding rather than greedy decoding to predict the peptides.

### Fixed

- Don't use model weights with incorrect major version number.

## [3.1.0] - 2022-11-03

### Added

- Matching model weights are automatically downloaded from GitHub.
- Automatically calculate testing code coverage.

### Changed

- Maximum supported Python version updated to 3.10.
- No need to explicitly specify a config file, the default config will be used instead.
- Initialize Tensorboard during training by passing its directory location.

### Fixed

- Don't use worker threads on Windows and MacOS.
- Fix for running when no GPU is available.

## [3.0.0] - 2022-10-10

### Added

- The first PyPI release! :tada:
- Tests are run on every PR automatically.
- Test code coverage must be maintained or improved with each change.
- Log the active Casanovo configuration.
- Log to both the console and a log file.
- Use all available hardware resources (GPU and CPU).
- Add ICML paper citation info.
- Document GPU out of memory error in the README.
- Allow mzML and mzXML peak files as input during predicting.
- Ability to reuse an existing HDF5 index during training.
- Move the changelog information from the README to CHANGELOG.

### Changed

- Consistent code formatting using black.
- Assign a negative score to peptide predictions that don't fit the precursor _m_/_z_ tolerance.
- Faster empty token detection during decoding.
- Consistently set the random seed to get reproducible results.
- Spectrum indexes are written to temporary HDF5 files.
- Use spectrum_utils for spectrum preprocessing.
- Rename the mode to predict peptides for unknown spectra from `test` to `predict`.
- Export spectrum predictions to mzTab files.
- Update the residue alphabet to include N-terminal modifications (acetylation, carbamidomethylation, NH3 loss).
- Specify input peak files as a shell pattern rather than by their directory.
- Make the config file optional to specify.

### Removed

- Always preprocess spectra, rather than having this as a user option.

### Fixed

- Don't log overly detailed messages from dependencies.
- Don't crash on invalid spectrum preprocessing.
- Ensure that config values have the correct type.
- Don't crash when an invalid residue is encountered during predicting (i.e. an N-terminal modification in another position).
- Don't penalize peptide scores if the precursor _m_/_z_ fits a C13 difference.
